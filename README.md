A simple contacts app where a random robot face is generated for each contact. Accesses the [Robohash API](https://robohash.org/) for generating robot faces, tachyons for styling, [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API for generating a few random users for demo purposes and React.js is handling the front-end.
